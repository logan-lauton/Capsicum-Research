### About Me
I am a Senior at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/data-science/) pursuing a bachelors of science in data science, with minor areas in computer science, economics, & mathematics. Over my academic career at Marquette I have learned how to use many coding languages such as Python, Java, R, SQL, and more all to help me further my understanding of computational analysis. This repository holds the project that I am undertaking which will help determine the ability of private gardeners to grow and  distribute wild Capsicum seeds from critically endangered species in the Capsicum Genus.
