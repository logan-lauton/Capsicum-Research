# Contributing

I'd love pull requests from anyone willing to contribute! By participating in this project, you
agree to abide by the thoughtbot [code of conduct](https://thoughtbot.com/open-source-code-of-conduct).

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Capsicum-Research.git
    
Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make the tests pass:

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/logan-lauton/Capsicum-Research/compare).

At this point you're waiting on me. I try to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). I may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.


Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

- Write tests.
- Write a [good commit message](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
