### About Me
I am a Senior at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/data-science/) pursuing a bachelors of science in data science, with minor areas in computer science, economics, & mathematics. Over my academic career at Marquette I have learned how to use many coding languages such as Python, Java, R, SQL, and more all to help me further my understanding of computational analysis. This repo, along with my others, are simply to showcase my projects and other fun activities that exemplify the ucurrent nderstanding that I have in the data science field.

### About this Repository

This repository holds the project that I am undertaking which will help determine the ability of private gardeners to grow and distribute wild capsicum seeds from critically endangered species in the Capsicum Genus. This research stems from the article [Four new species of Capsicum (Solanaceae) from the tropical Andes and an update on the phylogeny of the genus](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0209792) by some of the leading capsicum botanists such as [Gloria E. Barboza](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gloria-Barboza), [Carolina Carrizo Garc√≠a](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carolina-Carrizo-Garcia) and more. The article describes four new species of Capsicum, a plant species within the Solanaceae family, found in the Andean tropical forests of South America. The newly discovered species include Capsicum benoistii, Capsicum piuranum, Capsicum longifolium, and Capsicum neei. Each species is endemic to a particular region within South America and is closely related to other Capsicum species found in neighboring areas. The article provides a detailed description of the morphology and distribution of each species. Additionally, the article provides an update on the phylogeny of the Capsicum genus. The new species expand our understanding of the diversity of the genus and provide insights into its evolutionary history. Furthermore, based on the [IUCN](https://www.iucn.org/) criteria, all four newly discovered species of Capsicum (C. piuranum, C. benoistii, C. longifolium, and C. yurimagua) are proposed as endangered or critically endangered.
